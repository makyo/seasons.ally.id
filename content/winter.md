title: Winter

"Now Winter comes slowly, Pale, Meager, and Old,"[^29] Winter sings in *The Fairy Queen* (Purcell 1692).

Winter creeps. It eases into place. Even if there is a sudden, blustering storm to begin the season, that is but the first noise you hear. It creeps and crawls in because it cannot but creep and crawl. It's old. It's tired. "Dying sun, shine warm a little longer!" (Graves 1965, 206) we may beg,[^30] but all it wants to do is lie down and blanket the land.

Much of the imagery in poetry around Winter picks up on this, and we commonly see instances of blankets, of beds, of rest.

A blessing indeed ---
This snow on the bed-quilt,
This, too, is from the pure land

Perhaps it is because we so often experience Winter through the lens of contrast. We experience Winter through the warmth of fire. We experience Winter because it is *out there* and we are *in here* (or, failing that, we are experiencing Winter directly because we are *out there* and would very much rather be *in here*). We think of snow on the ground, we think of blankets because, yes, of course it looks that way, but also because we are primed to think of winter in terms of the contrasts to how cold such a blanket must be.

Or perhaps we think of Winter this way, of snow as a blanket, of sleepy silences, because the world really does seem to be asleep. It goes beyond mere hibernation; the whole world --- the Earth, the sky, the rivers and lakes --- all seem to be asleep. "I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields," Lewis Carroll writes (Carroll 1871). "That it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt, and perhaps it says, "Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.""

Even the snow itself seems destined for sleep, drifting down lazily in fat clumps or being blown nearly sideways, helpless, only to be piled up in immobile drifts. It's destined for sleep because what else would a blanket do?

I.
The snow is falling,
sleeping,
whispering,
dreaming of water.

\[\...\]

III.
A single snowflake awakens,
shimmers,
glows,
watches the world with weary eyes,
darkens,
settles,
and disappears.

(Esch, n.d.)

Wallace ties in this sleepiness with contrast --- as we shall do before long --- by contrasting the stillness of a world asleep with our faithful blackbird:

I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

(Stevens 1917)

Similarly, Graves has,

{{% verse %}}
She, then, like snow in a dark night
Fell secretly. And the world waked
With dazzling of the drowsy eye
So that some muttered 'Too much light,'
And drew the curtains close
Like snow, warmer than fingers feared
And to soil friendly;
Holding the histories of the night
In yet unmelted tracks

(Graves 1965, 143)

"As Earth stirs in her winter sleep," he writes elsewhere (Graves 1965, 173). "And puts out grass and flowers / Despite the snow / Despite the falling snow." Winter has crept in and tucked the world away to sleep for a while, and though we might stretch and peek out and, seeing the sun, think to ourselves, "I really must get up," we are helpless to actually do so. Make attempts, sure, but there is no waking from Winter on any terms other than Winter's.

It plays into the timelessness of that serenity. It is so quiet! It The contrast is so high! Morning light is the same as noon light is the same as afternoon light. How could time pass? Winter will not permit it.

It was evening all afternoon.
It was snowing
And it was going to snow.
The blackbird sat
In the cedar-limbs.

And, of course, perhaps we think of Winter this way because that very danger that keeps us inside. Winter, death-season that it is, can have snow as a funeral shroud as easily as a blanket. We are not *in here* simply because it is cold *out there*, but because that very cold brings death[^31]with it.

Issa says,

*Kore ga maa*

Is this it, then,
My last resting place ---
Five feet of snow!

The discursive nature of this section might itself be related to the blunted vision of the world after snow. How can we define the world around us when we can barely make out its edges? We cannot define Winter because it's so blurry around the edges. Obscured. Defined by contrast, but only the contrast of blackbirds or bare tree limbs, rather than one hill from the next, one house from the next. We can only pin it down by walking those paths, one by one, heading up to the top of the hill and looking down from there, walking up the drive to get a better look at the numbers tacked to the side of the house. There are so many perhapses and maybes to be had.

VI
Icicles filled the long window
With barbaric glass.
The shadow of the blackbird
Crossed it, to and fro.
The mood
Traced in the shadow
An indecipherable cause.

(Stevens 1917)

'Indecipherable' indeed.

And so, with an eye warmth and cold, to contrasts, to blankets and sleep, to softness and inexactitude, to death, we come to our final poem:

{{% verse %}}
*Dirt Garden*

My garden of foxtails and milk-thistle,
Alive and wild, more so than tended rows
In growth, has died. I killed them a little,
The crab-grass clumps, Datura and nettle.
"Time and time, I commit these small murders,
To whose benefit?" I ask why and wonder,
The scent of sap on scuffed and bloody hands.
If I indwelt some luring scrap of land
Far from here, secluded, my own to call,
I would welcome these same weeds, one and all,
To plant their roots in my warm, earthen roof,
Just they and I, with no need of reproof,
And thank the thorns for making a hale fence,
The compost for being my winter blanket.

(Dwale 2019, 5)

This fourteen-line poem is one of half-rhymes and mixed meter. We have 'all' and 'call', as well 'roof' and 'reproof' (which, depending on your accent, may not be a complete rhyme; many have roof as /ʊ/ or even /ɵ/)[^32], but beyond that, we get only hints of assonance: 'hands'/'land'.[^33]

We come around once more to the cyclical nature of time, as subsequent re-reads of the poem cycle us through multiple meanings.

Once more, the first half of the poem focuses on concrete imagery ("My garden of foxtails and milk-thistle", "The scent of sap on scuffed and bloody hands") and actions ("I killed them a little, / The crab-grass clumps, Datura and nettle", "I ask and wonder") which, when contrasted against the turn toward the more hypothetical and contemplative second half, offers on second reading a sense of immediacy.

On one's first read, one is confronted with the unwelcome nature of the real and the welcome nature of the hypothetical: these are weeds that must, according to some external source, be pulled, and yet in some perfect world, one might welcome them in. In both of these cases, the tension lies in the volta halfway through, where one imagines that the poet stands up from toil, a pile of vegetation at its feet, wipes the sweat from its brow, and asks for the hundredth time, "Time and time, I commit these small murders, / To whose benefit?"

From the second read on, however, as the reader re-evaluates the work, we know that the 'garden' in the first line is more than just a wistful statement, but a more active contrast from the external source. More than letting them grow wild, would the poet perhaps plant them intentionally? A thistle provides a beautiful purple blossom, and Datura's white trumpets its own poisonous beauty; why not? Arctic foxes, by virtue of their diet, wind up planting gardens above their dens, scanty cold-weather flowers peeking through after winter.[^34]

Even reading the poem top to bottom on repeat, one picks up subsequent layers one after another. Is the poet wishing for solitude? There is this rejection of external requests for someone's imagined benefit and talk of hedging (perhaps literally) oneself in "with no need for reproof". Is the poet musing on death when confronted with vegicide? An "earthen roof" has plain enough meaning.

And yet, even Winter must die, yes? That, after all, is right where we started. Winter, dead, and Spring with Summer unborn in her belly. The poem is bound in cycles. Our reading is bound in cycles. The year is bound in cycles and as we spiral up through the seasons, they leave us changed. We are not who we were last Winter, and yet it is Winter still. Every Winter is different, and in that they are the same.

How hard the year dies, and yet there is Spring. She has walked the grassy flat with him for the last time and, the golden bloom of Summer in her womb, has naught to do but nudge him to no effect.

[^29]: I wish you had died in Winter, Dwale. I wish you'd lived to comfort me through Falcon's death. Hell, I wish you'd lived to comfort me through your *own*. I wish you'd lived to the winter of your life, not to a mere 40 years. The very beginning of Autumn, for you! You had your plenty and your paucity. I wish you'd made it to 'Pale, Meager, and Old'.

    Of course I wish you hadn't died at all, but I wish you'd died in Winter if you had to.

[^30]: And perhaps do. I am not --- most of us are not --- immune to that simple desire that we have a little more time together. Another year, another month, another day. Even another hour together,enough time for me to tell you that I think of you often, that you mean a lot to me, that I hope you understand it.

    The last time we talked one-on-one, you was a month before you died, June 5^th^. You pinged me in the Guild chat asking me to DM you because you couldn't find my chat in your client: "Could you DM me right quick?". I sent you a surprised-looking sticker and you said, "Uh, just wanted to say that although I don't know what I ever did to deserve having your support, I do see and appreciate it."

    "You just strike me as an earnest and well-spoken. You do quite a bit to buoy others up, and that ought to be returned in kind," I said, but honestly, how the hell was I supposed to respond to that? That I think we both wind up in that spot where impostor syndrome becomes more dire? That any praise, any validation becomes almost too hot to touch?

    It's a haunting sort of message to be left with. That I should praise your work (for I think it was in response to my review of *Face Down in the Leaves*) and inspire that terrifying ordeal of being seen has me confused and upset, but I don't know that there's much to be done about it. I wanted to type so much more than I did, but this wasn't the place. The conversation wasn't open after that. It had closed up, the point having been made --- inadequately by either of us, I suspect --- and then I never got to say anything about it again.

[^31]: She was doing so bad that morning. Her belly was bloated and her gums were white and she was so lethargic. We didn't know it, but she was in shock at the time. So, we called the emergency vet and they said, "Oh, yeah, that sounds serious. Bring her in."

    "I'm up in Sultan. It'll be a good half hour before I make it down," I said.

    "Well, hurry."

    I took her outside and she awkwardly peed at the plum tree, so I waited while Zephyr and JD watched from the back door, and then, suspecting that she was maybe in too much pain to jump into the back of the car, I got a towel around her midsection and helped to lift her into it, but I don't think I did a very good job. She didn't yelp out in pain or anything, but she looked so stunned once she'd made it into the back seat. She stared up at me with eyes that showed fear, showed pain, showed some existential terror that I didn't know yet, because I think she knew. Something about the shock that she was in left enough knowledge in her, that I think she knew she was gone.

    I buckled her in by her harness, and drove. I talked to her all the way down the hill, down to Snohomish. I told her it'd be okay, that I was hurrying, that I loved her. I told her that she'd be alright, that it was probably just bloat, and that they could do surgery to fix it, that she'd be in pain for a few weeks, but she'd survive. She was only nine, after all, right? So many more years of chasing Zephyr around. So many more years of herding the cat.

    I sat with her in the back seat of the car, on hold with the emergency vet, while she rested her head on my lap. I was so cramped back there, I'm so tall, and my knees were mashed against the back of the driver's seat. She rested her head on the seat, nose hanging down into the messy footwell, and I pet her for nearly an hour as the hold music continued to play, interrupted by announcements to bring your pet in for vaccinations, please do not hassle the staff, we offer natural treatments for horses. I listened to the "You are caller number *n*" messages, I waited while *n* ticked down 7 6 5 4 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 and then I got to speak to the operator, letting them know that I was in the lot, and they said that I should've just pulled into one of the appointment spaces and brought her inside stupid stupid stupid and they wheeled a gurney out to meet me because they weren't sure if she could walk but she could so they put a leash on her and brought her inside and I had to wait in the car, watching as she made it in the lobby and got so scared that she urinated on the floor and lay down because she didn't want to be taken back to the X-ray machine without me and I think that's because she knew. She knew! She *knew*. She was dying and she knew.

    She knew.

[^32]: My accent has roof as /ɯ/ vs reproof as /u/.

    I do not know Dwale's accent. I do not know where it came from. I do not remember its address. I do not remember its voice. I met it twice in 2015, back at the final Rainfurrest, and all I remember was its hat, its hair, its kosovorotka. I remember Mando better, and saw him only a little bit more. I remember JM introducing Dwale as the one who wrote "the best story in the fandom, I hear", but that's about it. "Behesht", was it? The story about reaching paradise? The story of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, of the slow death of life, of the drive to press on towards something better that can only be stopped by death?

    I looked the story up when thinking about this, and came across the lines:

    "Peace, my brother," he said. "Come with us, and leave these wretched places behind. Where we are going is far better."
    
    When I inquired as to where that might be, he smiled and said a single word: "Behesht." Their destination was nothing less than Heaven itself, the hidden garden which is the reward of believers.
    
    (Dwale 2018a)

    That was back in 2015, though. That was seven years before it died. It's one of those things where it couldn't have known. It couldn't *possibly* have known, and yet I suppose it bore within itself the seeds of its death from birth, just as we all do.
