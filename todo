Footnote 16 on Autumn still has "\parencite"
Footnote 17 on Autumn is missing

Footnote 3 on Winter references 31-1, which is broken

Footnote 1 on Sprial after quote has straight quote
Footnote 6 on spiral 'performance' rather than 'performative' (maybe platitudes are performance, grief is performative?)
